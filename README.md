# GB-Homework

This is a rough draft of the homework.
It should fulfill all requirements, but it not documented yet and does not have unittests.  
Those are technically not requirements, writing code without documentation and without UTs just feels wrong and i will fix it asap.

I also was tempted to provide github actions to deploy it somewhere like Azure or any containerized hoster, but ... that would just have been too much.
